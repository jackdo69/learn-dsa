# Monotonic Queue | Stack - Sliding Window Maximum

Tags: monotonic, queue, sliding window, stack

### Question

*You are given an array of integers `nums`, there is a sliding window of size `k` which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the `k` numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position.*

*Return the max sliding window.*

### Ideas

- As the window slide, we need to keep track of the largest element in the array, instead of keep track of the whole array, we can do a decreasing array (monotonic queue) so the first element always the largest
- In order to know when that element is outside of the window, we store the index of the element instead of itself
- In order to make the queue decreasing, whenever we push the new item to the queue, we compare that item to the last item of the queue and keep popping

### Implementation

```jsx
function maxSlidingWindow(nums: number[], k: number): number[] {
  const queue: number[] = [];
  const res: number[] = [];

  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    // keep the queue in decreasing order
    while (queue.length && nums[queue[queue.length - 1]] < nums[i]) queue.pop();
    queue.push(i); // push the current index

    if (i === queue[0] + k) queue.shift(); // left element out of the window
    if (i >= k - 1) res.push(nums[queue[0]]); // first element always the largest
  }
  return res;
}
```
