# Bitwise

### Ideas

- AND `&`
    - if BOTH bits are `1` then the result is `1`
    - if ANY bit is `0` then the result is `0`
    - same as `&&` operator
- OR `|`
    - if BOTH bits are `0` then the result is `0`
    - if ANY bit is `1` then the result is `1`
    - same as `||` operator
- XOR `^`
    - if BOTH bits are the same then the result is `0`
    - if BOTH bits are different then the result is `1`
