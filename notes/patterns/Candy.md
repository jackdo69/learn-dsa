# Candy

### Question

There are `n` children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array `ratings`.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

- Each child must have at least one candy.
- Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.

Return *the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children*.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: ratings = [1,0,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.
```

### Ideas

- We need 2 passes, 1 from left, 1 from right
- if a child has a rating higher than its neighbor, we increment its candy
- the final result is the max of the value from left and from right (since this is the minimum value)
- `travelFromLeft` and `travelFromRight` represents the minimum number of candies required if we only look at the neighbors from `left` and `right` respectively

### Implementation

```jsx
function candy(ratings: number[]): number {
  const n = ratings.length;
  const travelFromLeft = Array.from({ length: n }, () => 1); // min 1 candy
  const travelFromRight = Array.from({ length: n }, () => 1); // min 1 candy
  for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    if (ratings[i] > ratings[i - 1]) travelFromLeft[i] = travelFromLeft[i - 1] + 1;
  }
  for (let i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
    if (ratings[i] > ratings[i + 1]) travelFromRight[i] = travelFromRight[i + 1] + 1;
  }
  let res = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    // need maximum as the the minimum number of candies required
    res += Math.max(travelFromLeft[i], travelFromRight[i]);
  }
  return res;
}
```
