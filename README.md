# DSA Interview Prep System

A comprehensive, pattern-based approach to mastering Data Structures & Algorithms for technical interviews.

## What's Inside

This repository contains **75 algorithm patterns** organized into a complete 6-week study system designed to help you:
- **Understand** core DSA concepts and how they relate
- **Recognize** which pattern to apply to new problems
- **Practice** systematically with a structured learning path
- **Master** technical interviews through pattern-based thinking

## Quick Start

### 1. Understand the Big Picture
Read **[concept-relationships.md](concept-relationships.md)** to understand how all patterns connect (30 min)

### 2. Start Your Study Plan
Open **[study-plan.md](study-plan.md)** and begin Week 1, Day 1

### 3. Track Your Progress
Use **[practice-tracker.md](practice-tracker.md)** to mark patterns as you learn them

### 4. Practice Pattern Recognition
When solving problems, use **[pattern-recognition-guide.md](pattern-recognition-guide.md)** to identify the right approach

### 5. Before Interviews
Review **[quick-reference.md](quick-reference.md)** - your one-page cheat sheet

## Study System Overview

### 📅 6-Week Study Plan
- **Week 1-2:** Fundamentals (Arrays, Two Pointers, Sliding Window, Stack, Strings, Linked Lists)
- **Week 3:** Trees & Graphs (DFS, BFS, Dijkstra, Union Find, Topological Sort)
- **Week 4:** Backtracking & Greedy (Decision-making patterns, Heaps, Design patterns)
- **Week 5-6:** Dynamic Programming (All 11 DP patterns)

### 🎯 Daily Routine (2-3 hours)
1. Study pattern from notes (30 min)
2. Implement from scratch (45 min)
3. Solve 2-3 practice problems (45 min)
4. Review connections (30 min)

### 📈 Progress Tracking
- **Target:** 60+ patterns mastered before interview
- **Practice:** 150+ problems solved (2-3 per pattern)
- **Speed:** Pattern recognition in < 2 minutes
- **Implementation:** Medium problems in < 25 minutes

## Pattern Categories Covered

### Core Data Structures
Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, Heaps, Tries

### Algorithm Techniques
- **Searching:** Binary Search, DFS, BFS
- **Two Pointers & Sliding Window**
- **Graph Algorithms:** Dijkstra, Bellman Ford, Floyd Warshall, Topological Sort, Union Find, MST
- **Dynamic Programming:** 11 distinct patterns (1D, 2D, Grid, Knapsack, LIS, LCS, etc.)
- **Backtracking:** Subsets, Permutations, Combinations, Partitioning
- **Greedy:** Intervals, Scheduling, Optimization
- **Advanced:** Monotonic Stack, Prefix Sum, Cyclic Sort, Floyd's Cycle Detection

## How This System Helps

### ✅ Structured Learning
No more random problem solving - follow a proven progression from basics to advanced

### ✅ Pattern Recognition
Learn to identify "this is a sliding window problem" or "this needs DP + Binary Search" in seconds

### ✅ Deep Understanding
Understand WHY patterns work and WHEN to use them, not just memorizing solutions

### ✅ Interview Ready
- Quick reference cheat sheet
- Pattern recognition decision trees
- Code templates for common patterns
- Common pitfalls and how to avoid them

### ✅ Progress Visibility
Track mastery levels for all 75 patterns and know exactly where you stand

## Key Features

- **75 Algorithm Patterns:** Complete coverage of interview topics
- **TypeScript Implementations:** Clean, working code for every pattern
- **LeetCode Problem Mapping:** 150+ curated problems organized by pattern
- **Spaced Repetition Schedule:** Built-in review system for retention
- **Pattern Combinations Guide:** Learn how patterns combine in hard problems
- **Pre-Interview Checklist:** Final week preparation guide

## Success Metrics

Track in practice-tracker.md:
- Patterns mastered: X / 75
- Problems solved: X / 150+
- Pattern recognition speed: < 2 min
- Implementation speed: < 25 min (medium)

## Learning Philosophy

**Pattern-Based > Problem-Based**

Instead of solving 300 random problems, master 75 patterns that cover ALL problem types. When you see a new problem, you'll think: "This is just pattern X with a twist" rather than "I've never seen this before."
